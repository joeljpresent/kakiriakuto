# KakiRiakuto

*Some shameless plagiarism of [KaKiKuKeKo.fr][k5] using ReactJS*.

[KaKiKuKeKo.fr][k5] is a website created by Florian Delmas that allows French-speaking learners of Japanese to learn and revize Japanese vocabulary.

KakiRiakuto (かきリアクト) is just a toy project replicating the base idea of Florian Delmas's website and I don't plan to expand on it at the moment.
